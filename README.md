DESCRIPTION:

🧠 Interactive Quiz Application

The Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based project developed as Task-1 of the CODTECH Internship Program.

The project is designed to create an engaging and interactive platform where users can test their knowledge through multiple-choice questions.

The application combines strong functionality with a simple and attractive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the quiz and understand their performance.

The application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are fundamental technologies for front-end web development.

HTML is used to structure the quiz content, including questions, options, buttons, and score display.

CSS is used to enhance the visual appearance of the application, ensuring a clean layout, proper alignment, and responsiveness across different devices.

JavaScript is responsible for implementing the quiz logic, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating webpage content.

The quiz dynamically loads questions from a predefined question set, allowing smooth navigation without page reloads.

Users can select answers using interactive options provided in the interface.

The application immediately evaluates user responses and provides instant feedback for both correct and incorrect answers.

This real-time feedback system helps users stay engaged and improves the learning experience.

The application continuously tracks the user’s score using JavaScript logic as the quiz progresses.

At the end of the quiz, the final score is displayed clearly, giving users a summary of their overall performance.

The scoring system ensures accurate evaluation and provides a sense of completion to the user.

The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it suitable for users of all experience levels.

A key learning objective of this project is the effective use of DOM manipulation and event handling.

JavaScript dynamically updates questions, options, and scores based on user actions.

Event listeners manage interactions such as answer selection and question navigation to ensure a smooth and responsive experience.

The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provided features such as syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and error detection to improve development efficiency and code quality.
